    <h1>You are Subscribed</h1>
    <p>Gamify sends reminder emails about the goals you've set. We try to keep this to a minimum, but reminders are some of the best ways
        to get your mind into a task. Gamify will send you at most two emails every day, one in the morning for any goals you have to do
        that day and one in the evening only if you have goals that aren't done yet.</p>
